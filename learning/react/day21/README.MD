ðŸ“š W4D21: React Routing
This README covers core concepts of client-side routing, key differences with server-side routing, and building a simple Todo list with multiple routes using React Router DOM v5.

ðŸš¦ Core Concepts
Client-Side Rendering (CSR): Loads a single HTML file and dynamically updates content on the client side, creating a Single Page Application (SPA).

Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Pages are rendered on the server and sent fully formed to the browser.

Single Page Application (SPA): A web app that loads a single HTML page and updates content dynamically.

Multi-Page Application (MPA): Each page is a separate HTML file fetched from the server.

Client-Side Routing vs. Traditional Routing:

CSR: Changes URL and renders components without reloading the page.

Traditional: Each URL change reloads the whole page from the server.
