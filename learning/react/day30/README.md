ðŸ§ª Day 30: Testing in JavaScript & React
This README covers core concepts of unit testing, end-to-end (E2E) testing, coverage expectations, and modern testing tools like Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress.

ðŸ“– Testing Overview
Testing ensures your application works correctly and prevents bugs when you make changes.

âœ… Unit Testing
ðŸ”¹ Key Tools:

Jest:

Intro to Jest

Jest mock functions

React Testing Library: For testing React components by focusing on user behavior.

TDD (Test-Driven Development): Write tests first, then implement code to pass them.

BDD (Behavior-Driven Development): Describe tests in natural language.

Tools: Cucumber (for writing scenarios in plain English).

ðŸ”¹ Legacy tools (good to know):

mocha

enzyme

chai

ðŸ”¹ Useful reads:

mock_api call

this testing series (if you have time).

ðŸ“Š Coverage
Target: 90%+ code coverage.

Low coverage reasons:

Unnecessary code.

Incomplete test cases.

ðŸš€ E2E (End-to-End) Testing
ðŸ”¹ Tools:

Cypress

Playwright

Selenium (legacy; good to know its existence).
