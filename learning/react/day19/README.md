üìö Day 19: Redux
This README covers core Redux concepts, differences from Context API, and instructions for a full-stack CRUD Todo list app with Redux and JSON server.

üìñ Core Redux Concepts
Three core concepts:

Store: The single source of truth holding your app‚Äôs state.

Action: Plain objects describing what happened (contain type and optional payload).

Reducer: Pure functions receiving the previous state and an action to return the next state.

Reading state from store:

Use hooks like useSelector or mapStateToProps (if using class components) to access Redux state in your components.

Updating state in Redux:

Only way to update Redux state is by dispatching an action with dispatch().

üìù Key Redux Questions
What is Redux?

Global state management library.

Encourages a single store as the source of truth.

Uses reducers, actions, and dispatch to manage state changes.

Designed for predictable state updates.

Redux Components:

Reducers: Pure functions returning new state.

Action: Contains type and optional payload.

Dispatch: The only way to send actions to reducers.

üîÑ Redux vs Context API
Feature Redux Context API
Usage Standardized for global state management. Flexible, minimal setup.
Best for Large-scale applications. Small apps/simple state.
Pros Middleware support, DevTools integration. Simpler for small needs.
Cons More boilerplate, setup complexity. Not optimized for frequent updates.

‚úÖ How to Read and Update State in Redux
Read: Use useSelector((state) => state.someSlice.someValue) in components.

Update: Use dispatch(someAction(payload)) to send actions to reducers.

üõ†Ô∏è Homework / Project
Goal: Build a full-stack CRUD Todo list with Redux.

Requirements:

Manage two global states:

todos (CRUD operations).

theme (light vs dark mode).

Use json-server as the backend API to persist todos.

üöÄ CRUD Todo List Instructions
Setup Backend:

Install json-server globally or locally.

Create db.json with initial data for todos.

Run server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
Setup Frontend with Redux:

Create Redux slices or reducers for todos and theme.

Connect Redux store to your React app using <Provider>.

Use redux-thunk or redux-saga if you need side effects for async CRUD.

CRUD Features:

Create: Add new todo items.

Read: Fetch existing todos from json-server.

Update: Edit or toggle todo completion.

Delete: Remove todo items.

Theme Feature:

Create a Redux slice to toggle light/dark mode.

Update app styling based on current theme state.
